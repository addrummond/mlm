# Manual

## Overview

**Mode:** reflective, ambient light

**Range:** EV -3.5 to 19 at ISO 100

**Field of view:** 40° (horizontal FOV of 50mm lens on full frame)

## Turning the meter on

The meter does not have an on/off switch. It is always ready to detect a press
of the center pad.

If the meter has remained used for around 6 hours, it goes into “deep sleep”
mode. In this mode it may be necessary to press and hold the center pad for up
to a second before the meter responds.

Due to careful use of low energy sleep modes, the battery drains very slowly
when the meter is not in use. If you use the meter at least once every couple of
months then there is no point in removing the battery.

The meter cannot be woken up by pressing the left or right pads.

## Basic operation

Take a reading by pointing the sensor window towards the subject and 
pressing and holding the center pad.

While the reading is in process, the lights on the wheel cycle rapidly. Once the
reading is complete, the lights stop cycling and the reading is displayed.

Let go of the center pad once the reading is complete.

Read off the aperture and shutter speed.

## Battery

The meter is powered by a single CR2032 coin cell. The cell should be inserted
with the positive side facing away from the circuit board. The meter won't be damaged
if the cell is inserted the wrong way round, but will not function.

When a new battery is inserted, the light for f8 will turn on for around 10
seconds. When this light goes out, initial calibration of the touch pads is
performed (which takes a fraction of a second). For best results, rest the meter
on the case while the light is still on and wait for a second after the light goes
out before touching the meter.

## Changing the aperture and shutter speed.

While a reading is displayed, tap the left or right pad to move
beetween equivalent exposures. For example, if the exposure shown is 1/60 at f8,
tapping the left pad will switch to 1/125 at f5.6.

Out of the box, the first reading is displayed with the aperture fixed at f8
(unless a very bright or very dark scene makes this impossible). On subsequent
readings, the meter attempts to preserve the last selected aperture.

## Third stops

The two lights inside the wheel indicate changes of ±⅓ stop. The light on the
left means “go ⅓ stop counterclockwise”; the light on the right
means “go ⅓ stop clockwise”.

**Example:** the exposure shown is 1/60 at f8 and the right light is on. This
indicates that the following are correct exposures:

* 1/80 at f8 (adjusting the shutter speed by ⅓ stop), and
* 1/60 at f9 (adjusting the aperture by ⅓ stop).

## Reading display timeout

After a reading has been displayed for around 20 seconds, the meter will
automatically sleep. Tap the center pad to wake the meter up and display the
last reading.

## Changing the ISO

The meter is set to ISO 100 by default. To change the ISO, press the left and
right pads simultaneously while the meter is displaying a reading. The currently
set ISO is indicated by a single pulsing light. Tap the left and right pads to
adjust, then tap the center pad to confirm and return to the reading display.

All ISO numbers shown on the inside of the wheel are full stop ISOs. Third stop
ISOs are shown as bullets. If one of these ISOs is selected, you can adjust it
by ±⅓ stop by pressing and holding the left or right pads until one of the ±⅓
stop indication lights turns on. The left light means“go ⅓ stop
counterclockwise” (i.e., decrease the ISO number slightly), while the right
light means “go ⅓ stop clockwise” (i.e., increase the ISO number slightly).

When a reading is in progress, one light stays on uninterrupted while the others
cycle. This light indicates the currently selected ISO (or the nearest full stop
ISO to it).

## Special display of low light exposures

Using two indicator lights (one for aperture and one for shutter speed), the
wheel can show exposures down to -⅓EV at any given ISO. As the lower range of
the meter is -3.5EV at ISO 100, this means that at ISOs below 1600, the EV can
be low enough that no corresponding exposure can be displayed in the usual way.
In this circumstance, the meter indicates exposures longer than one second by
turning on three shutter speed lights rather than one. The number corresponding
to the middle light should be interpreted as a number of seconds. For example,
if the lights corresponding to 2, 4 and 8 are lit up, this indicates an exposure
of four seconds.

## Out of range indication

If the scene is too bright or too dark for the meter, the three lights at the
top of the wheel (corresponding to f5.6, f8 and f11) turn on simultaneously.
