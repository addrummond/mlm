## Overview

The $NAME is a reflective light meter with a range of EV -4.5 to 17.5 at ISO
100. The field of view is 90°. This is the horizontal field of view of an 18mm
lens on full frame.

The meter has three touch pads (center, left and right). Readings and other
information are displayed on a wheel made up of 24 lights. Two additional lights
inside the wheel indicate adjustments of ±⅓ stop.

The meter is suitable for taking ambient light readings under most lighting
conditions. It does not have flash metering functionality.

## Battery

The meter is powered by a single CR2032 coin cell. The cell should be inserted
with the positive side facing away from the circuit board. The meter will not
work with the cell inserted the wrong way round (but won't be damaged).

## Turning the meter on

The meter does not have an on/off switch. It is always ready to detect a press
of the center pad.

If the meter has remained used for around 6 hours, it goes into “deep sleep”
mode. In this mode it may be necessary to press and hold the center pad for up
to a second before the meter responds.

Due to careful use of low energy sleep modes, the battery drains very slowly
when the meter is not in use. If the meter is used at least once every couple of
months then there is no point in removing the battery.

The meter cannot be woken up by pressing the left or right pads.

## Basic operation

Take a reading by pointing the sensor window towards the subject and 
pressing and holding the center pad.

While the reading is in process, the lights on the wheel cycle rapidly. Once the
reading is complete, the lights stop cycling and the reading is displayed.

Let go of the center pad once the reading is complete.

Read off the aperture and shutter speed.

## Changing the aperture and shutter speed.

While a reading is displayed, tap the left or right pad to move
beetween equivalent exposures. For example, if the exposure shown is 1/60 at f8,
tapping the left pad will switch to 1/125 at f5.6.

Out of the box, the first reading is displayed with the aperture fixed at f8
(unless a very bright or very dark scene makes this impossible). On subsequent
readings, the meter attempts to preserve the last selected aperture.

## Third stops

The two lights inside the wheel indicate changes of ±⅓ stop. The light on the
left means “go ⅓ stop counterclockwise”; the light on the right
means “go ⅓ stop clockwise”.

**Example:** the exposure shown is 1/60 at f8 and the right light is on. This
indicates that the following are correct exposures:

* 1/80 at f8 (adjusting the shutter speed by ⅓ stop), and
* 1/60 at f9 (adjusting the aperture by ⅓ stop).

## Reading display timeout

After a reading has been displayed for around 20 seconds, the meter will
automatically sleep. Tap the center pad to wake the meter up and display the
last reading.

## Out of range indication

If the scene is too bright or too dark for the meter, the three lights at the
top of the wheel (corresponding to f5.6, f8 and f11) turn on simultaneously.

## Changing the ISO

The meter is set to ISO 100 by default. To change the ISO, press the left and
right pads simultaneously while the meter is displaying a reading. The currently
set ISO is indicated by a single pulsing light. Tap the left and right pads to
adjust, then tap the center pad to confirm and return to the reading display.

All ISO numbers shown on the inside of the wheel are full stop ISOs. Third stop
ISOs are shown as bullets. Towards the upper end of the ISO range, no third stop
positions are shown between the full stops. If one of these ISOs is selected,
you can adjust it by ±⅓ stop by pressing and holding the left or right
pads until one of the ±⅓ stop indication lights turns on. The left light means
“go one third of a stop counterclockwise” (i.e., decrease the ISO number
slightly), while the right light means “go one third of a stop clockwise” (i.e.,
increase the ISO number slightly).

When a reading is in progress, one light stays on uninterrupted while the others
cycle. This light indicates the currently selected ISO (or the nearest full stop
ISO to it if it is a ⅓ stop ISO and there is no dedicated light).
